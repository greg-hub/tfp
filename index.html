      The Frenulum Pendulum Is a black comedy drama that follows a Northumberland shepherd as he helps one of his heifers as she struggles to calf. Jackie needs help and his best mate, Steve, is nowhere to be seen. A garbled phone call from Donna saying Steve is in trouble forces Jackie to abandon his cow to find Steve.

  
As he shows up at Donnas house he follows the blood trail to discover Steve naked in the bath, broken penis under the showerhead. The tail of debauchery deepens further as Jackie finds his other friend Seppi in the bed and Donnas husband, a local police officer on his way home.
  

Chaos ensues, as Donna wants to keep the lads there to take the brunt of Tonys rage. Jackie faces the dilemma of whether to help his friends or leave them to get back to his heifer.
